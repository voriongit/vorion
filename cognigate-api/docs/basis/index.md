# BASIS

## Baseline Authority for Safe & Interoperable Systems

**The open standard for AI agent governance**

---

## The Problem

AI agents are making autonomous decisions. Right now, there's no standard way to:

- **Verify** an agent will behave within bounds
- **Trust** that governance checks happen before action
- **Audit** what decisions were made and why
- **Interoperate** between different agent systems

Every company is building their own governance. None of it talks to each other. None of it is verifiable.

---

## The Solution

BASIS is an open standard that defines **what must happen before an AI agent acts**.

## The Four Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Key Question |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| [**INTENT**](/intent) | Understand what the agent wants to do | "What is being attempted?" |
| [**ENFORCE**](/enforce) | Check if it's allowed based on trust & policy | "Should this be permitted?" |
| [**PROOF**](/proof) | Create immutable audit trail | "What happened and why?" |
| [**CHAIN**](/chain) | Anchor proofs to blockchain | "Can this be independently verified?" |

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Governance Before Execution
No autonomous action proceeds without passing through governance checks. Period.

### 2. Trust is Quantified
Not binary allow/deny, but graduated trust scores (0-1000) that unlock capabilities progressively.

### 3. Everything is Auditable
Every governance decision is logged with enough detail to reconstruct exactly what happened.

### 4. Open Standard, Many Implementations
BASIS is the spec. Anyone can build a compliant implementation. No vendor lock-in.

## Trust Tiers

| Tier | Score | Capabilities |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 🔴 Unverified | 0-99 | Sandbox only |
| 🟠 Provisional | 100-299 | Basic operations |
| 🟡 Certified | 300-499 | Standard operations |
| 🟢 Trusted | 500-699 | Extended operations |
| 🔵 Verified | 700-899 | Privileged operations |
| 💎 Sovereign | 900-1000 | Full autonomy |

## Why Open?

**For Developers:**
- Build once, deploy anywhere
- No proprietary lock-in
- Community-driven improvements

**For Enterprises:**
- Vendor-neutral standard
- Auditable compliance
- Interoperable agents

**For the Ecosystem:**
- Shared infrastructure costs
- Network effects for trust
- Rising tide lifts all boats
