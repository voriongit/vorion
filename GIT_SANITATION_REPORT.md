# Git Repository Sanitation Report

**Date**: 2025-01-25  
**Repository**: c:\Axiom  
**Report Status**: NEEDS ATTENTION

---

## Current State Summary

### Branch Health
```
Local branches:
  - master (HEAD) ✓ Clean, on track
  - cleanup/marketplace-removal ⚠️ Stale (orphaned local)

Remote branches:
  - origin/master ✓ Up to date
  - origin/feature/aci-integration ⚠️ Ahead of master (NEW CHANGES)
  - origin/claude/review-master-pr-GaMRG ⚠️ Stale review branch
```

### Commit Divergence
```
Local master:  6d8b44e (Fix: Scale test values 0-100 to 0-1000)
Remote master: afca1d5 (feat: comprehensive ACI consolidation)
Local is ahead: 7 commits unpushed

Remote feature/aci-integration: 0c3e203 (fix(aci): remove trust tier from ACI identifier)
  Latest change: Trust tier removed from ACI string format (runtime computed)
```

### Working Directory Status
```
Uncommitted changes: 197 items
  - Modified: 26 files
  - Deleted: 9 files
  - Untracked: 162 files

Major uncommitted changes:
  ✓ README.md (updated with @vorionsys/aci-spec links)
  ✓ Core trust-engine files
  ✓ Test files (0-1000 scale fixes)
  ✓ Contracts package exports
  ⚠️ Phase completion documents (PHASE1-5_COMPLETE.md, etc.)
  ⚠️ Large untracked artifacts (docs/, scripts/, configs/)
```

## Issues Identified

### 🔴 CRITICAL
1. **Diverged branches**: Master and feature/aci-integration have diverged
   - Master: 6d8b44e (merged ACI, scaled tests)
   - Feature: 0c3e203 (skill bitmask, format fixes) - is NEWER than our master
   - The feature branch has newer changes that should be merged

2. **197 uncommitted changes**: Mixed staged and untracked files
   - Phase completion documents not tracked
   - Many untracked artifacts from project execution
   - Could cause merge conflicts if pulling feature branch

### 🟡 WARNING
1. **Stale review branch**: claude/review-master-pr-GaMRG (2+ days old)
2. **Orphaned local branch**: cleanup/marketplace-removal (should be deleted locally)
3. **Untracked build artifacts**: Knowledge-index.json, status.json files proliferating

### 🟢 GOOD
- Local master is clean relative to uncommitted changes (has diff, but intentional)
- Remote tracking is correct
- No merge conflicts detected

## Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

### IMMEDIATE (Next 5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Stash uncommitted Phase documents and artifacts
cd c:\Axiom
git stash push -m "wip: Phase completion docs and project artifacts"

# 2. Fetch latest from remote
git fetch origin

# 3. Review feature/aci-integration before merge
git diff master origin/feature/aci-integration --stat

# 4. Merge feature/aci-integration into master
git merge origin/feature/aci-integration

# 5. Verify tests pass
npm test -- --run
```

### SHORT TERM (Next 30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Delete stale local branch
git branch -d cleanup/marketplace-removal

# 2. Delete stale review branch
git push origin --delete claude/review-master-pr-GaMRG

# 3. Push updated master
git push origin master

# 4. Verify git status is clean
git status
```

### MEDIUM TERM (Session end)
```bash
# 1. Re-apply Phase documents (stashed)
git stash pop

# 2. Add Phase documents to repo
git add PHASE*_COMPLETE.md GIT_SANITATION_REPORT.md

# 3. Commit with proper message
git commit -m "docs: Add phase completion reports and git sanitation"

# 4. Push documentation
git push origin master
```

### CLEANUP
```bash
# Remove untracked build artifacts
rm -r apps/*/knowledge-index.json
rm -r apps/*/status.json
rm -r packages/*/knowledge-index.json
rm -r packages/*/status.json

# Or selectively:
git clean -fd packages/*/
git clean -fd apps/*/
```

## Merge Strategy

**Base**: master (current HEAD: 6d8b44e)  
**Source**: origin/feature/aci-integration (0c3e203)  
**Type**: Fast-forward friendly (feature branch is newer)

**What will merge**:
- Skill bitmask system ✓
- ACI format corrections ✓
- Type system updates ✓
- Export additions ✓

**Risk assessment**: LOW
- No conflicting changes identified
- All updates are additive or corrections
- Tests should still pass after merge

---

## Expected Outcome After Cleanup

```
✓ Master is on latest commit with skill system & format fixes
✓ All phase work documented in committed files
✓ Stale branches deleted
✓ Working directory clean
✓ Ready for Phase 6: Trust Engine Hardening
```
