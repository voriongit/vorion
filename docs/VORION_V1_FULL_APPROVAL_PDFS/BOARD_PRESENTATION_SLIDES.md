# Slide 2: Executive Summary

## Vorion V1: Governed AI Execution

### The Problem We Solve
Enterprises need AI capabilities but face:
- Regulatory uncertainty (EU AI Act, GDPR)
- Audit & accountability requirements
- Risk of uncontrolled AI behavior
- Compliance burden

### Our Solution
**AI execution with built-in governance**
- Every action constrained by rules
- Every decision auditable
- Every execution recorded immutably
- Humans always in control

# Slide 3: How Vorion Works

## The Governance Pipeline

```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│  INTENT  │───▶│ ENFORCE  │───▶│ EXECUTE  │───▶│  PROOF   │
│          │    │          │    │          │    │          │
│  Parse   │    │   Gate   │    │   Run    │    │  Record  │
│  Goal    │    │  Check   │    │  Action  │    │ Evidence │
└──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
```

### Key Principle: Separation of Powers

| Component | Role | Cannot |
|-----------|------|--------|
| BASIS | Defines rules | Execute anything |
| Cognigate | Executes actions | Change rules |
| PROOF | Records evidence | Modify records |

**No single component has unchecked authority**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    DEFENSE IN DEPTH                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 1: Perimeter    │ WAF, DDoS, TLS 1.3            │
│  Layer 2: Network      │ Micro-segmentation            │
│  Layer 3: Application  │ Input validation, RBAC        │
│  Layer 4: Data         │ AES-256, field encryption     │
│  Layer 5: Monitoring   │ SIEM, 24/7 SOC                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Security Metrics

| Metric | Industry Avg | Vorion | Delta |
|--------|--------------|--------|-------|
| Time to patch (critical) | 30 days | 4 hours | 180x faster |
| Vulnerability backlog | 50+ | 0 high/critical | Best in class |

# Slide 8: Threat Landscape

## Risk Assessment Summary

### Top Threats & Mitigations

| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|--------|------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Credential compromise | Medium | High | MFA, rotation, monitoring | Low |
| Data exfiltration | Medium | Critical | DLP, encryption, segmentation | Low |
| AI model manipulation | Low | High | Constraint enforcement | Very Low |
| Evidence tampering | Very Low | Critical | Cryptographic chains | Negligible |
| Insider threat | Low | High | Least privilege, audit | Low |

### No Critical or High Residual Risks

All identified threats have been mitigated to acceptable levels.

# Slide 9: Trust & Autonomy Model

## Adaptive AI Governance

### Trust Score Framework

```
Trust Score (0-1000) =

    Behavioral History ████████████████████  40%
    Compliance Record  ██████████████        25%
    Identity Strength  ████████████          20%
    Context Factors    ██████                15%
```

### Autonomy Progression

| Level | Score Range | Human Involvement | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| L0 | 0-199 | All actions approved | New entities |
| L1 | 200-399 | Most actions approved | Probation |
| L2 | 400-599 | Exceptions approved | Standard ops |
| L3 | 600-799 | Audit only | Trusted ops |
| L4 | 800-1000 | Post-facto review | Privileged |

**Key Insight:** Trust earned slowly, lost quickly
