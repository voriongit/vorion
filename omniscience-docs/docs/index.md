## The Agentic AI Knowledge Base

**A community-driven, comprehensive reference for autonomous AI agent development.**

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can **autonomously perceive, reason, plan, and act** to achieve goals with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional AI that responds to single prompts, agentic systems:

- **Persist** across interactions, maintaining state and memory
- **Plan** multi-step actions to achieve complex objectives
- **Use tools** to interact with external systems and APIs
- **Adapt** based on feedback and environmental changes
- **Collaborate** with other agents and humans

## Why This Matters

The agentic AI landscape is evolving rapidly:

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2022 | ChatGPT demonstrates conversational AI at scale |
| 2023 | AutoGPT, BabyAGI spark autonomous agent research |
| 2024 | Tool use becomes standard (function calling) |
| 2025 | MCP, A2A protocols emerge for interoperability |
| 2026 | Governance frameworks (BASIS) address safety |

**We're building the infrastructure for AI agents to work safely alongside humans.**
