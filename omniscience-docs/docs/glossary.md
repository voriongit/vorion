## Key Terms in Agentic AI

This glossary provides definitions for common terms used throughout the Omniscience knowledge base.

---

## A

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)
Google's open protocol enabling direct communication between autonomous AI agents. Covers discovery, capability advertisement, and task delegation.

### Agent
An autonomous system that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve goals. In AI, typically refers to LLM-based systems with tool access.

### Agent Card
In A2A protocol, a JSON document describing an agent's capabilities, endpoints, and skills. Published at a well-known URL for discovery.

### ATSF (Agent Trust Scoring Framework)
A multi-dimensional framework for evaluating agent trustworthiness across performance, security, compliance, and behavioral metrics.

### Audit Trail
A chronological record of agent actions, providing accountability and enabling forensic analysis.

---

## B

### BASIS (Blockchain Agent Standard for Identity and Security)
A comprehensive framework combining identity, trust scoring, capability management, and governance for autonomous agents.

### BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention)
A cognitive architecture where agents maintain beliefs about the world, desires (goals), and intentions (committed plans).

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
The ability of a distributed system to reach consensus even when some participants are malicious or faulty.

---

## C

### Capability Gating
The practice of restricting agent capabilities based on trust level, context, and authorization.

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
A prompting technique where the model generates intermediate reasoning steps before reaching a final answer.

### Consensus Protocol
An algorithm enabling distributed agents to agree on a shared value or decision, even in the presence of failures.

### Constitutional AI
A training approach where AI systems learn to follow a set of principles (a "constitution") through self-critique and revision.

### Corrigibility
The property of an AI system being willing to be corrected, modified, or shut down by its operators.

---

## D

### DID (Decentralized Identifier)
A URI that resolves to a DID Document, providing verifiable, decentralized digital identity. Format: `did:method:identifier`

### Delegation Chain
A sequence of capability delegations from one agent to another, with constraints that can only be tightened.

---

## E

### Embedding
A numerical vector representation of text, images, or other data, enabling semantic similarity comparisons.

### Episodic Memory
Memory storing specific experiences or events, as opposed to general knowledge (semantic memory).

### Evolution
In agentic AI, the process by which agents improve their capabilities over time through learning, optimization, or self-modification.

---

## F

### Few-Shot Learning
Providing a small number of examples in the prompt to guide model behavior.

### Fine-Tuning
Further training a pre-trained model on specific data to adapt it for particular tasks or domains.

---

## G

### Goal-Based Agent
An agent that selects actions based on achieving explicit goal states, often using search or planning.

### Guardrail
Safety constraints that limit agent behavior, preventing harmful or undesired actions.

---

## H

### Hallucination
When an AI model generates false or fabricated information that appears plausible.

### Hierarchical Orchestration
Multi-agent coordination where agents are organized in a tree structure with supervisor-worker relationships.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
System design where humans review, approve, or correct AI decisions at certain points.

---

## I

### In-Context Learning
The ability of large language models to learn from examples provided in the prompt without parameter updates.

### Intent Classification
Determining the user's goal or purpose from their input.

---

## K

### Knowledge Base
A structured repository of information that agents can query to inform their decisions.

### Knowledge Distillation
Transferring knowledge from a larger "teacher" model to a smaller "student" model.

---

## L

### LLM (Large Language Model)
A neural network trained on large amounts of text data, capable of generating and understanding natural language.

### Long-Term Memory
Persistent storage of information across agent sessions, enabling continuity and learning.

---

## M

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Anthropic's open protocol standardizing how AI assistants connect to external tools and data sources.

### Meme (Memetic)
In evolutionary terms, a unit of cultural information (idea, practice, knowledge) that can spread between agents.

### Memory System
The components that allow agents to store, retrieve, and use information across time.

### Multi-Agent System
A system composed of multiple interacting agents, often with different specializations.

---

## N

### Neuro-Symbolic AI
Approaches combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning for improved reliability and interpretability.

---

## O

### Orchestration
Coordinating multiple agents to work together on complex tasks.

### Oversight
Human monitoring and control mechanisms ensuring agents behave as intended.

---

## P

### Planning Engine
A component that generates sequences of actions to achieve goals, often using search algorithms.

### Prompt Engineering
The practice of crafting effective prompts to elicit desired behavior from language models.

### Pub-Sub (Publish-Subscribe)
A messaging pattern where senders (publishers) emit events without targeting specific receivers (subscribers).

---

## R

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
A technique combining information retrieval with language generation to produce more accurate, grounded responses.

### ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)
An agent pattern interleaving reasoning traces with action execution.

### Recursive Self-Improvement
An agent's ability to modify its own capabilities, potentially in a compounding manner.

### Reflex Agent
An agent that responds directly to percepts with actions based on condition-action rules.

### Revocation
The process of removing a previously granted capability or credential.

---

## S

### Sandboxing
Executing code or actions in an isolated environment to prevent unintended effects.

### Semantic Memory
Long-term storage of general knowledge and facts, as opposed to specific experiences.

### Seeding
Initializing an agent with knowledge, examples, and configurations before deployment.

### Self-Improvement
An agent's ability to enhance its own capabilities through reflection and modification.

### Swarm Intelligence
Collective behavior emerging from decentralized agents following simple rules.

---

## T

### Tool Use
An agent's ability to invoke external functions, APIs, or systems to accomplish tasks.

### Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
A reasoning approach where the model explores multiple reasoning paths as a tree structure.

### Trust Score
A quantitative measure of an agent's trustworthiness, typically multi-dimensional.

---

## U

### Utility-Based Agent
An agent that chooses actions to maximize an expected utility function over possible outcomes.

---

## V
